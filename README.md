A collection of work related to COVID-19

The 'Realtime R0 Global Predictions' notebook is an adaption of Kevin Systrom's work on predicting Covid-19 infection rates. Instead of US data, global data is processed. The data is being updated daily by https://ourworldindata.org and automatically imported in this notebook. 

UPDATE: The HDI function has been improved which reduces the processing time significantly. The whole notebook can now complete within a few seconds.
